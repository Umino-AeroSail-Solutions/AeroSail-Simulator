# AeroSail-Simulator
Focused on the development of a simulator that simplifies and simulates the behaviour of an AeroSail system

## Profile
The profile class allows for the creation of custom airfoils using a seed airfoil and adding flaps to it. It uses the PyXfoil (https://github.com/Xero64/pyxfoil) repository to compute aerdynamic coefficient values for these airfoils.
